# BT2102-Project-Slides

This was a group project for a data visualization module in university.

This project was based around a dataset focusing on housing prices in Beijing from 2011-2017 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruiqurm/lianjia). As a group, our objectives were to come up with three level 1 business questions and multiple level 2/3 business questions based off each level 1 question, and then generate insights for and answer all of them.

For data cleaning and preparation, we mainly used Microsoft Excel to remove null values and Rstudio for further data manipulation and normalisation. Tableau was primarily used afterwards for data visualization to obtain insights about the trends in the housing prices in Beijing.
